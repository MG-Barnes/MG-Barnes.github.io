# Aim

Biology has no distinct separation between the material, structure, and machine. Rather, there is a nested, cohesive functionality across all length scales to produce extraordinary functions where the material itself is the machine. To bridge the gap between engineered and biological soft solids our group merges recent polymer advances to design smart materials with hierarchical functionality for applications in soft-robotics, responsive biomimetic devices, and haptic displays. 

# Methods

At the **molecular** level, we use chemistry to obtain sophisticated intrinsic functionality such as dynamic bonds for ’green’ recylability or memory and azo-benzene derivatives for photo-responsiveness, and liquid crystals for phase-dependent shape-shifting. 

At the **microscopic** level we leverage bottom-up self-assembled microstructures in chemistry, such as self-assembled liquid crystal microstructures, and also use top-down fabrication techniques, such as nano-lithography, to engineer microstructures for biomimetic structures or microfluidics. 

At the **macroscopic** level we use mechanics to model the multi-scale responses of materials. When coupled with smart manufacturing, such as 3D printing, this allows for quantitative designs, including kirigami and metamaterials, to achieve remarkable functionality from unremarkable materials. 

While control over polymers at the molecular-, micro-, and macro-length scales is individually established, the challenge persists to design nested functionality across all length scales to achieve exceptional multi-faceted smartness. Our group aims to address this issue to manufacture smart materials for wide-ranging applications in the health, defense, and aerospace sectors.
